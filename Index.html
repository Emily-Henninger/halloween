<h1> Halloween: The Best Holiday </h1>
<h2><u>Point 1</u></h2>
<p>It's my darn birthday. End of point. </p>
<h2><u>Point 2</u></h2>
<p>You get tons of candy, and it's fantastic. There are two types of people in this world:
   those who hoard their candy until it's next Halloween and they realize that they still have their old candy,
  and those who eat it all in one night. Both of these situations involve much regret.</p>
<h2><u>Point 3</u></h2>
<p>When a TV show you like has a Halloween special, it's always the best episode of the season.
  Christmas specials are good, too, but they always have to have some moral message about the 
  'True Meaning of Christmas.' <b>Boring.</b> Halloween specials are just plain fun, and usually 
  don't involve learning experiences.

</p>
  <h2><u>Other Misc Points</u></h2>
<ul>
    <li>If you wear a mask while you're trick-or-treating, no one can tell you're 17</li>
    <li>Cool, spooky decor is everywhere</li>
    <li>Socially acceptable time to play dress-up</li>
  </ul>
